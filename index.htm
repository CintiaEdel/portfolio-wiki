            <h2>How to use this page</h2>
            <p>This page is part of a portfolio, used as a work example. The page is not fully functional, since that would be a waste of time. Only the first option from each navigation bar and part is functional, in other words, the only things which make something happen if you click on it will be the "Boss" section in the "Dark Souls 1" dropdown, and inside there, only the "Gwyn, Lord of Cinder" section. All of this serves as an example of how a fully functional page based on this would look.</p>

Solo la primera opción de cada barra de navegación y apartado es funcional, es decir, las únicas cosas que harán que algo ocurra cuando haces click en ellas serán la sección "Boss" en el desplegable "Dark Souls 1" y, ahí, solo el apartado de "Gwyn, Lord of Cinder".

            <h2>The Souls Saga</h2>
            <p>Dark Souls is a series of action role-playing games developed by FromSoftware and published by Bandai Namco Entertainment. It began with the release of Dark Souls (2011) and has seen two sequels, Dark Souls II (2014) and Dark Souls III (2016). The series was created by Hidetaka Miyazaki and has received critical acclaim, with its high level of difficulty being among its most discussed aspects, while the first Dark Souls is often cited as one of the greatest games of all time. By 2023, the series had shipped over 35 million copies outside of Japan. Other FromSoftware games, including Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring, share several related concepts and are commonly grouped together as Soulsbornes.</p>
            <p>The games take place within a dark, medieval fantasy setting, where the player's character fights against knights, dragons, phantoms, demons, and other monstrous or supernatural entities. The accretion, loss, and recovery of souls are central to the narrative and gameplay of Dark Souls games. These games are linked through their setting and an overarching cyclic narrative centering around fire, and are linked through common themes and elements, including interactions with phantoms and battles with demons. At the end of each game, characters may reignite the "first flame" or allow it to fade, recurring a choice others have made before.</p>
            <p>The Dark Souls games are played in a third-person perspective, and focus on exploring interconnected environments while fighting enemies with weapons and magic. Players battle bosses to progress through the story, while interacting with non-playable characters. The protagonist of each Dark Souls game can have a varying gender, appearance, name, and starting class via character creation. Players can choose between classes, including knights, barbarians, thieves, and mages. Each class has its own starting equipment and abilities that can be tailored to the player's experience and choices as they progress. The player gains souls from gameplay battles which act as both experience points to level up and as currency to buy items. Souls gained are usually proportional to the difficulty of fighting certain enemies; the more difficult an enemy, the more souls the player will gain from defeating it.</p>

            <h2>From Software</h2>
            <p>FromSoftware, Inc. is a Japanese video game development and publishing company. It was founded by Naotoshi Zin in Tokyo on November 1, 1986. Initially a developer of business software, the company released their first video game, King's Field, for the PlayStation in 1994. Its success shifted FromSoftware to focus fully on games, with them producing two more King's Field games before creating the mecha combat series Armored Core (1997), one of their flagship franchises.</p>
            <p>By the 2000s, FromSoftware's releases included the Echo Night, Shadow Tower, Lost Kingdoms, Otogi, and Another Century's Episode series. The company achieved breakout success in the 2010s with Demon's Souls (2009) and Dark Souls (2011), the latter being the first entry in a trilogy whose success led to the creation of a subgenre of action role-playing games known as Soulslikes. These include FromSoftware's Bloodborne (2015), Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice (2019), and Elden Ring (2022), which are often cited as among the greatest video games of all time.</p>
            <p>Hidetaka Miyazaki, creator of the Dark Souls series, has served as FromSoftware's representative director and president since 2014, with Zin remaining as an advisor. Despite his executive duties, Miyazaki directs and designs the majority of the company's games. FromSoftware is owned primarily by Kadokawa Corporation, with minority stakes by Tencent subsidiary Sixjoy Hong Kong and Sony Interactive Entertainment. FromSoftware usually self-publishes in Japan and partners with companies such as Agetec, Sony, and Bandai Namco Entertainment to publish internationally.</p>

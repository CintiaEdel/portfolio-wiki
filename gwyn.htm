            <h2>Information</h2>
            <p>Gwyn, also known as Gwyn, Lord of Sunlight, Gwyn, Lord of Cinder and Lord Gwyn is a character in Dark Souls and the final boss of Dark Souls.</p>
            <p>Gwyn, Lord of Cinder was a mighty warrior and the greatest of lords. He was known as the Lord of Sunlight and headed the efforts to end the Age of Ancients, together with Gravelord Nito, the Witch of Izalith, and the dragon-traitor, Seath the Scaleless. Commanding his knights, he led the Lords to victory and oversaw the Age of Fire. Despite being partially bequeathed to the Four Kings and Seath the Scaleless, his soul remains "a powerful thing indeed".</p>
            <p>Around a thousand years prior to the start of the Dark Souls game events, Gwyn sacrificed himself to link the First Flame. His reasons for doing so are disputed, but what is certain is that his principal motivation was to postpone the end of the Age of Fire. He was succeeded by his children: his firstborn, the banished God of War who lost his status as a deity; his daughter Gwynevere, the Queen of Sunlight; and his lastborn Gwyndolin, his "repulsive [and] frail" son who Gwyn raised as a daughter due to Gwyndolin's affinity for the Moon.</p>
            <p>It will come as no surprise to anyone who has spoken to Kingseeker Frampt, Darkstalker Kaathe, or the illusion of Gwynevere, that Lord Gwyn is the final boss of the game, and that it is the Chosen Undead's goal to either succeed him and end further Undead sacrifices, or start the Age of Dark: the apparent age of Humanity. Lord Gwyn can be fought after acquiring all Lord Souls and Lord Soul Shards and returning them to the Lordvessel at Firelink Altar, which will grant access to the Kiln of the First Flame. After fighting past five of his Black Knight, a Hollowed and haggard Gwyn awaits at the site of the First Flame, presenting himself as the final challenge.</p>
            <h2>Strategy</h2>
            <p>Gwyn has many different attacks, mostly involving a non-stop barrage of sword swings which will take down your shield and stamina quickly. So while he may seem as if he hasn't got any weaknesses, rest assured knowing he does, and if timing is one of your strengths, then you're in the driver's seat; <b><i>Gwyn can be parried</i></b>.</p>
            <p>The standard strategy is to keep Gwyn far enough away so he misses his attacks made against you, while adding a combination of rolling and quick attacks and backing off. This way you can slowly whittle away his health and beat him. Also, hiding behind one of the large rocks near the center of the room so he hits the rock rather than you can be an advantage; when he goes for a grab and misses, go in for a hit and back off. You can also hit him after he finishes his 3-4 hit combo.</p>
